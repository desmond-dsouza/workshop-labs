{- ðŸ‘‰ TODO:
      - You already have `view` as a function, and an `initialModel`
      - You already have many update-related functions, like `step` and `turn`
      - You will need to `import` `simpleGameApp` and other items from Lib.WkApp
          - And will no longer need `GraphicSVG.App` or `graphicsApp`
      - In `Types.elm` define Msg type as: Tick Float GetKeyState
          - Tick will tell us a time slice has elapsed
          - GetKeyState will give information about keys pressed
          - GetKeyState = (Keys -> KeyState, _, _)
          - We only need the 1st item in GetKeyState to detect specific keys
      - Use `simpleGameApp` in your `main` -- it will need an `update`
      - Write a dummy `update` function that just `steps` the model (animation)
          - Your goal is just for `simpleGameApp` to compile and run
      - When the snake eats the apple, just let the new apple be in the same place (for now)
      - Add type `UserRequests` (in Types.elm) to describe the main user requests that accompany each Tick
          - Turn in some direction
          - Start new game
          - None of the above / just keep going
      - Add helper `userRequest: (Keys -> KeyState) -> UserRequests`
      - Use it and extend `update` to turn the snake
      - Extend `update` to start a new game on demand

   If you finish the above early, you can try this to move the food around a bit:
      - Alternate the apple between 2 fixed locations coded into `nextFoodLocation`
      - nextFoodLocation : Food -> Food -- given current food location, what is the next one
