       At first just a single darkRed circle will do. Get it to display.

       If you complete the rest of this lab early:
          - Add a small green stem, sized and positioned relative to `size`.
              However, you have to return a single `Shape`, not a list. 
          ðŸ’¡ HINT: see `group` function
          - Make the apple body fancier e.g. use two overlapping `oval`s
